This repository consists of GCN, GAT and transfer learning model with ResNet101 implemented in pytorch.
The Features folder contains extracted features from the ResNet101 model which are used to train the GAT and GCN models.
The data used for training the ResNet101 model is available in kaggle. Anyways I have the link here.
